# credit_score_analysis


### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a Credit Score Classification System that evaluates the creditworthiness of individuals based on their financial data. This system will classify individuals into different credit risk categories (e.g., low risk, medium risk, high risk) based on predefined rules and criteria. 

### Data Source
credit score: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "train.csv" file,containing detailed information about the credit score.

### Tools
- Numpy 
- Pandas 
- Seaborn 
- Matplotlib

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
This is the initial phase,we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formating.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the credit score to answer key questions,such as:

- What is the payment behaviour of most people?
- What is the credit score according to occupation?

### Key finding from the data 
The analysis of the credit card data has revealed several common patterns and trends among credit score, distribution count of credit cards, annual income, monthly income salary, occupation and payment behaviour. Let us explore it more.

### Results and finding
- The analysis demonstrates that the majority of customers are middle-aged with moderate to high incomes and stable salaries. 
- Credit scores are generally "Standard," with higher-income individuals tending to have better credit scores and lower outstanding debts. 
- Payment behaviors vary, with a notable trend towards smaller, frequent payments or high-value transactions. 
- Financial management is notably better among certain occupations.
